ext.js App (Powered by Bun)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the **preferred runtime and package manager** for maximum speed and simplicity.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

> ⚠️ This project uses **Bun**. Please do **not** use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`, as this can cause dependency or lockfile conflicts.

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

This will read the package.json file and install dependencies using Bun, generating a bun.lockb file.

2️⃣ Start the Development Server

You should see your Next.js app running.
